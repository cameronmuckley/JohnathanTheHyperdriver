# Johnathan The HyperDriver

This is our game: Johnathan The HyperDriver! It’s a game where you play as an inexplicably nonplussed otter, who has been genetically created by an evil scientist to test his brand new world domination device. Johnathan must find a way to escape the scientist’s evil clutches with his life, but to also keep this device out of the scientist’s hands. The core gameplay loop is currently to use your abilities and platforming skills to solve a level and progress to the next level, eventually unlocking new abilities as you progress. </br>

Johnathan the Hyperdriver has user friendly tips for teaching its controls along the way. The main controls are played through the use of the WASD keys for movement, Space to jump and to "Continue" from the Death screen, L to enter Hyperspeed, K to Light Zip across a crystal, R to restart from the last checkpoint and ESC to quit. </br>
